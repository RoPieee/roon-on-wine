# Running Roon on Linux with Wine

This script makes it possible to run Roon on Wine. It creates a separate Wine instance in a folder; this is required for Roon.

Right now the script is very rudimentary: more stuff is coming soon. Keep in mind that you need the following programs to be installed on your Linux system:

* wine
* winetricks
* winecfg
* wget

## Wine version

With respect to which version of Wine... this is a bit 'hit-and-miss'. 

# Install 
To install Roon just clone or download this repository and run <code>./install.sh</code>

Be patient, as installing the necessary components for Wine can take some time. Don't be scared of the messages that flood the console: drink a coffee and wait...

The installation is basically unattended. When the Roon installer starts you will need to click 'Install'.

When finished you can start Roon with <code>./start_my_roon_instance.sh</code>

## UI scaling issues
Wine is not capable (yet) to automatically scale the UI accoring screen resolution.
You can however manually adjust the scaling factor by editting the <code>start_my_roon_instance.sh</code> script, change the <code>SCALEFACTOR</code> variable and restart.
* Sensible values are betweein 1.0 and 2.0

# Supported distro's
This scripts has been reported to work on:

* ArchLinux
* KDE Neon
* openSUSE
* Fedora
  * Don't use the WineHQ repo, but just the Fedora-native Wine (<code>sudo dnf install wine</code>)
* Ubuntu
* Linux Mint

<b> Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) / Linux Mint 20x requires at least 'winehq-stable' (wine version 7.0+) or 'winehq-staging' (wine version 7.22+) </b>

If your distro is missing please leave a note!
